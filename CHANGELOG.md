# Changelog

All notable changes to KV Cache Tester will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Circuit breaker controls** (`--max-consecutive-errors`, `--circuit-breaker-window`): The "consecutive connection errors" abort is now configurable instead of hardcoded to 10. Set `--max-consecutive-errors 0` to disable it (or a high value like `1000`) for chaos/resilience runs where killing a backend worker is the intended test. The breaker now also only trips when no successful request has completed within `--circuit-breaker-window` seconds (default 30), so a simultaneous burst of mid-stream drops can't abort a run while surviving capacity stays healthy. `--itpm-budget` and `--otpm-budget` now mark individual users as `rate_limited` (with exponential backoff + jitter) when their predicted cost exceeds the budget, instead of stalling the entire dispatch loop. Matches production behavior and Layer 1 concurrency limits. Smaller users can still dispatch when the bucket has remaining capacity but isn't enough for a larger user ahead of them.
- **SLO compliance summary at end of test**: Test summary now reports `TTFT met`, `Decode met`, `Goodput (both)`, `Effective TTFT met` (includes queue time), and `Effective goodput` with counts and percentages. Driven by `--slo-ttft` and `--slo-decode-tps`.
- **Reproducible trace advancement**: Per-user advance position is now derived from `--seed` via a stable SHA-256 hash of the user_id, making advance positions deterministic regardless of API timing or PYTHONHASHSEED.
- **Sub-agent spawning**: Sub-agent traces are now replayed as separate concurrent users instead of being flattened into the parent timeline. The parent pauses while sub-agents run, matching real Claude Code behavior. Eliminates cache thrashing from context switching (20% → 95% server-side cache hit rate).
- **Timing strategies** (`--timing-strategy`): Separate API processing time from client think time for flexible replay:
  - `think-only` (**default**): Client think time only — requests fire as fast as the server can process them, with real client delays (tool execution, user reading) preserved
  - `original`: Use trace timestamp differences (backward compatible, includes original API processing time)
  - `api-scaled`: `prev_api_time * scale + think_time` — simulates faster/slower server
  - Use with `--api-time-scale FLOAT` (e.g., `--api-time-scale 0.2` for 5x faster server)
  - Requires traces built with timing data (`api_time`, `think_time` fields)
- **Accurate output token counting**: Uses tokenizer to count actual tokens per streaming chunk instead of assuming 1 token per chunk. Live output token log captures in-flight decode tokens for accurate per-period output tok/s reporting.
- **Pull-back conversation truncation**: When context resets occur (>10% of hash_ids removed), the conversation is truncated to the kept prefix boundary instead of wiped entirely. Preserves prefix content for cache hits on the surviving portion.
- **Advance scope control** (`--advance-all-users`): By default only initial users are advanced into traces; ramp-up/recycled users start from the beginning. Use `--advance-all-users` to advance everyone.
- **Global hash_ids support**: Traces with `hash_id_scope: "global"` have consistent hash IDs across parent and sub-agents, enabling correct cross-context cache simulation
- **Cooldown-based ramp gating** for `trace_replay_tester.py`: Prevents death spirals where a single good period after sustained overload triggers premature user additions
  - Requires 2-5 consecutive good periods before ramping (scaled by distress severity)
  - In-flight gate at >75% of max concurrent requests blocks ramp
  - Minimum 20% headroom floor prevents ramp at dangerously low margins
  - Post-cooldown throttle limits first 2 ramps to +1 user
  - Normal ramp formula less aggressive: `1 + headroom/15` (was `2 + headroom/10`)
- **Trace advancement** (`--advance-min`, `--advance-max`): Start users partway through traces to simulate joining with existing conversation history
- **Time-windowed working set tracking**: Working set display shows 1m, 5m, 15m windows

### Changed
- **Mid-stream disconnects no longer count toward the circuit breaker**: A stream that drops *after* the first token (classified internally as `stream_disconnect`) is treated as a transient/retryable error rather than a hard connection failure. Only connection failures that occur *before* the first token (e.g. connection refused) feed the consecutive-error counter. This prevents a killed backend worker from aborting an otherwise-healthy run.
- **Period user state display**: Replaced snapshot-based display (`active, idle, rate-limited, N ran requests`) with period-wide mutually-exclusive categories summing to total: `active, idle, rate-limited`. Priority: rate-limited (any time this period) > active (had requests or in-flight) > idle. Rate-limited count is always shown (including `0`) so the presence of rate limiting is always visible.
- **"No data" display for throughput metrics**: Input tok/s, output tok/s, and workload cache hit rate now display `⏳ No data` (matching existing TTFT pattern) when no prefill data or decode chunks are observed in a period, instead of displaying `0`.
- **Curated v8 trace set**: Replaced 522 paired traces with 739 curated unpaired traces. Filters: removed single-request, >900K-token, <60% cache rate, and frequent-compaction (>5% pullbacks) conversations. Traces now use `one request per turn` format (proxy bug fixed upstream in seifghazi/claude-code-proxy#33).
- **Diverse vocabulary for synthetic text generation**: Replaced ~92-word vocabulary with ~2,000 unique terms across 20 topic domains (web frontend, backend/API, database, DevOps, cloud, Python, JavaScript, data science, testing, security, networking, git, Linux/shell, monitoring, performance, documentation, build systems, storage, message queues, mobile). Uses topic-based templates to generate realistic prompts. Affects all three testers: `trace_replay_tester.py`, `single_prompt_tester.py`, and `cache_rate_tester.py`. New shared `vocabulary.py` module.
- **Default timing strategy changed to `think-only`**: Requests fire as fast as the server can handle, with only real client delays preserved.
- **Default `--ttft-metric` changed from `p95` to `avg`**: Average TTFT is more practical for ramp decisions.
- **`--chunk-size` default changed from 256 to 64** to match trace `block_size` (fixes 4x inflated working set token reports)
- **`--no-color` option for all tools**: Disable colored output for light terminal backgrounds
  - Works with single_prompt_tester, cache_rate_tester, and working_set_tester
  - Useful when terminal colors are hard to read on light backgrounds
- **Unified working_set_tester modes**: Fixed mode now behaves like sustained mode
  - Both modes use assessment periods for stats collection
  - Both modes support working set growth during the test
  - Fixed mode keeps concurrency constant (no ramping up/down)
  - Changed `--fixed-concurrency-levels` to `--fixed-concurrency` (single value)
  - Summary shows min-max working set range (e.g., "51K-205K")
- **Per-test token summary**: After each cache hit rate test completes, displays total processed input/output tokens
  - Shows total requests, input tokens (with M suffix), output tokens (with M suffix)
  - Aligned with graph calculations for consistency
  - Works in both modes: fixed and sustained
- **Final summary table**: At end of all tests, displays comprehensive results table
  - Shows all test results sorted by context size and cache hit rate
  - Columns: Context, Cache%, Requests, Input Tok, Output Tok, Input/s, Output/s, Avg TTFT, Concurrency
  - Includes grand totals for requests and tokens processed
  - Provides quick overview of entire test run
- **Brief mode token totals**: Extended `--brief` output with token statistics
  - Added requests, input_tokens, output_tokens columns to CSV
  - Added total_requests, total_input_tokens, total_output_tokens summary lines
- **Documentation restructure**: Moved detailed tool documentation to `docs/` directory
  - `docs/single_prompt_tester.md` - single_prompt_tester usage
  - `docs/cache_rate_tester.md` - cache_rate_tester usage
  - `docs/working_set_tester.md` - working_set_tester usage
  - `docs/utilities.md` - utility scripts usage
- **Simplified README**: Now has brief overview with links to detailed docs
- **`--context-sizes` option for single_prompt_tester.py**: Specify exact context sizes to test (e.g., `--context-sizes 8000 32000 64000`) instead of using min/max-tokens doubling
- **Unified index.html generator**: `generate_index.py` now auto-detects test type and generates appropriate dashboard for all tools (single_prompt, cache_rate, working_set, sustained, combined)
  - Consistent styling across all test types
  - Auto-detects test type from output files
  - Reads config from progress.json or metadata.json
  - single_prompt_tester.py now uses the unified generator
- **`--brief` mode for all tools**: Agent-friendly output mode for single_prompt_tester, cache_rate_tester, and working_set_tester
  - Suppresses verbose logging, only shows warnings/errors
  - Outputs minimal, parseable CSV-like format at completion
  - Format: key-value header, blank line, CSV header, CSV data rows, blank line, output path
  - Useful for automation and integration with AI agents
- **`--concurrent-prompts` / `-n` option for single_prompt_tester.py**: Send N prompts simultaneously
  - Uses `asyncio.gather` to fire all prompts at once
  - Useful for testing server behavior under concurrent load
  - Reports per-prompt metrics plus batch-level statistics (avg TTFT, batch time)
  - Both unique (cold) and cached (warm) tests send all N prompts concurrently
- **`--cached-repeats` / `-r` option for single_prompt_tester.py**: Run cached prompt multiple times
  - After the unique prompt, repeat the cached prompt N times (default: 1)
  - Useful for measuring cache hit consistency and warm-up effects
  - Each repeat is labeled `(repeat 1/N)`, `(repeat 2/N)`, etc.
  - All cached repeats are aggregated together in summaries and graphs
- **Improved CLI output for single_prompt_tester.py**:
  - Added per-context-size summary after all iterations complete
  - Added final summary table at end showing all context sizes
  - Added blank lines between iterations for better readability
  - Brief mode now shows per-context summaries during testing and formatted final table
- `.gitignore` file to exclude test artifacts (`output/`, `*.log`, `__pycache__/`, etc.)

### Changed
- `generate_graphs()` function now requires `config: TestConfig` parameter in both tools
- Updated comparison logging to only show when strict mode is NOT enabled (since filtered data is already being used)
- **Resume behavior improved**: When resuming tests, loaded aggregated results are now filtered against `progress.json` to remove any partial/incomplete results from interrupted runs
  - Only results marked as completed in `progress.json` are kept
  - Partial results are discarded and tests are re-run completely
  - Provides clean, consistent data and prevents duplicate entries

### Fixed
- **working_set_tester index.html now shows all context sizes**
  - Previously, when testing multiple context sizes with multiple cache hit rates, only the last context size would appear in the dashboard
  - Now uses unified `generate_index.py` like other tools for consistent behavior
- **Critical: `--strict-time-window` flag now works correctly**
  - Fixed throughput calculations to filter requests BEFORE calculation when `--strict-time-window` is enabled
  - Previously, the flag would filter requests but throughput was calculated from unfiltered data, causing incorrect metrics
  - Now all calculations (aggregated metrics, ramp decisions, and graphs) properly respect the strict time window
- **Fixed duplicate entries crash in graph generation**
  - Added deduplication in `generate_graphs()` to handle resumed tests
  - Prevents "Index contains duplicate entries, cannot reshape" error in heatmap generation
  - Keeps most recent entry when same test configuration runs multiple times
- **Ramping logic now respects `--strict-time-window`**
  - Ramp phase TTFT threshold checks now use filtered metrics when strict mode is enabled
  - Peak concurrency selection is now based on strict window performance
  - Binary search refinement also respects strict window filtering
  - This ensures that concurrency decisions are made based on "in-window" request performance only
- **Graph generation now respects `--strict-time-window`**
  - Variability bands in graphs now calculated from filtered data when strict mode is enabled
  - Previously graphs recalculated from phase metadata without checking the flag
  - Now both main graph lines and variability calculations use consistent filtering

### Removed
- **Adaptive mode**: Removed `--mode adaptive` option from cache_rate_tester.py
  - Sustained mode (default) provides better production capacity planning
  - Fixed mode covers specific concurrency level testing needs
  - Reduces code complexity (~550 lines removed)
  - Only `sustained` and `fixed` modes remain
- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed unused `generate_continuous_index` function (~220 lines)
  - Was superseded by unified `generate_index.py` which auto-detects test type
- **Redundant working_set_tester code**: Removed ~130 lines of `run_fixed_concurrency_mode` function
  - Fixed mode now uses the same `run_continuous_mode` function as sustained mode
- **Duplicate index generation**: Removed `generate_sustained_index_html` function (~250 lines)
  - Was causing index.html to only show last context size when testing multiple
  - All tools now use unified `generate_index.py` for dashboard generation

## Notes

### What `--strict-time-window` Does

When `--strict-time-window` is enabled:
- **Only requests that completed within the ramp duration window are used for all calculations**
- Throughput metrics reflect only "in-window" performance
- Ramp decisions (TTFT threshold checks, peak concurrency selection) use filtered metrics
- Graphs show filtered data with variability calculated from filtered requests
- Late-completing requests still finish gracefully but are excluded from metrics

This is useful for understanding steady-state performance without being affected by cleanup overhead from requests that started near the end of the time window but finished late.
